# React/Redux Movie Sagas Project

## Description

Duration: 3 days

This project is a React/Redux Project that displays a set of movies and by clicking the posters you are entered into a detail view for each specific movie. The page displays the set of movies and the details page is specific to the movie that was clicked on using URL parameters. Data is stored using redux reducers and asynchronous functions are handled by the sagas. This project was styled using CSS and more specifically Material UI.

This project uses React Router to go from the home page to the details pages and a button on the details page will take you back to the home page.
